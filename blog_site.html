      <h2>Travel</h2>
      <p>Traveling is one of the most enriching experiences life has to offer. It opens our eyes to new cultures, challenges our perspectives, and gives us stories that last a lifetime. Beyond the Instagram-worthy views and thrilling adventures, traveling fosters personal growth, boosts creativity, and teaches resilience.
       <br> I've been lucky enough to explore some breathtaking treks in Himachal Pradesh—particularly around Manali and Palampur—and every trail left its own mark on me. The Beas Kund trek near Manali, for instance, was unforgettable. Reaching the glacial lake where the 
       sage Vyas is believed to have meditated felt both surreal and grounding. The crisp air, surrounded by towering peaks like the Shitidhar and Hanuman Tibba, made the effort more than worth it.
        In Palampur, the Bir-Billing route offered a different flavor of adventure. Famous for paragliding, the trek up to Billing gave panoramic views of the Kangra Valley, lush with tea gardens and pine forests. It’s a place where time feels slower and nature pulls you into the moment.
        Each trek reminded me that travel isn’t just about changing locations—it’s about discovering parts of ourselves along the way. Whether it’s navigating tough terrain or sharing campfire stories with strangers-turned-friends, these moments shape who we are.

      <h2>Journey</h2>
      <p><b>My Developer Journey So Far</b>
      Over the past few months, I've dived deep into web development, building everything from the ground up using <i>vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS</i>.  I challenged myself to create full-stack projects without relying on any frontend frameworks—just pure JavaScript, Express, and SQL powering the entire stack. <br>This hands-on approach taught me how the web really works behind the scenes.
     <br> Now, I'm stepping into the world of React, leveling up my skills in building dynamic user interfaces. I’ve also had the incredible opportunity to intern at IIT Jammu, where I’ve been honing my development practices and working on real-world applications. This is just the beginning—and I’m excited to keep growing.

      <h2>Football</h2>
      <p><b>Why I Fell in Love with Football</b>
        My journey with football truly began in 2015, and it was FC Barcelona that stole my heart. The way they moved the ball with elegance, precision, and purpose—especially under the legacy of players like Messi, Iniesta, and Busquets—felt more like poetry in motion than sport. Their philosophy of possession, short passing, and total football wasn’t just effective, it was beautiful.
      <br>  Alongside Barça, I’ve always admired the dominance of Manchester United during the Sir Alex Ferguson era. From the never-say-die comebacks to legends like Rooney, Giggs, and Scholes, United embodied a spirit of resilience and ambition that’s hard to forget. That blend of tactical discipline and raw passion is something I still carry with me whenever I watch them today.
        For me, these two clubs didn’t just teach me the game—they shaped the way I understand and love football
