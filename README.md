# 🌐 Summer School Assignment Day 3 – Blog Layout

<b>This is a lightweight, responsive blog layout built using **pure HTML and CSS** as part of my assignment under **IIT Jammu's Summer School Program**.
</b>
<h1>
<b>## 📌 What It Does</b></h1>
<ul>
<b></b>The webpage is a mock blog design that includes:
<li>- A **header** welcoming users</li> 
<li>- A **sticky sidebar** for blog categories </li>
<li>- A **main content section** with multiple blog post entries</li>
<li>- A **footer** for credits and closing information</li>
</ul>
The goal was to understand how to structure a complete page without relying on frameworks or libraries—just clean, native web development.

<h2>## 🎨 CSS Concepts Used</h2><br>

<h4>### ✅ Layout Techniques</h4><br>
- **CSS Grid** for defining the entire page layout with multiple areas (`header`, `sidebar`, `main`, `footer`)
<br>- **Responsive units** like `fr`, `vh`, `%` for flexible scaling

<h4>### ✅ Sticky Sidebar</h4><br>
- Used `position: sticky` with `top: 0` to keep the sidebar visible while scrolling
<br>- Controlled stacking with `z-index`
<br>
<h4>### ✅ Typography & Styling</h4><br>
- Custom Google Fonts: `Cinzel`, `Roboto Slab`, and serif fallbacks
<br>- Letter-spacing and text transformations for a more editorial look
<br>
<h4>### ✅ Colors & Visual Design</h4><br>
- Linear gradients for a **deep ocean-inspired theme**
<br>- Hover effects for navigation links
<br>- Subtle shadows and translucent content backgrounds for better readability
<br>
<h4>### ✅ Usability</h4><br>
- Semantic HTML structure: sections, header, footer, nav
<br>- Scrollable `.content` for better readability on smaller screens

## 🚀 What I Learned<br>
- How `grid-template-areas` can simplify complex layouts
<br>- How `sticky` behaves inside a grid and how to control element layering
<br>- Fine-tuning spacing, overflow, and typography without any frontend frameworks
